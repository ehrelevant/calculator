# Calculator

This project is a web-based calculator program made for "The Odin Project". For this project I will be mostly applying JavaScript functions, objects, and methods, along with html and css to create a functional Calculator.

This calculator is a work-in-progress and still lacks a few features that will be added later ("Current Operation Display", Negatation functions, etc.). Moreover, some cleaning and organizing of the code, as well as some further styling will need to be done before this project is truly completed. Despite that, as it stands, this program is already highly-functional and can do many basic calculations.
